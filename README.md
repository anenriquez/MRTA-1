A Competency Adjustment and Workload Balancing Framework in Multi-Robot Task Allocation

This paper proposes a framework for competency adjustment and workload balancing
in multi-robot task allocation. Competency represents the ability of a robot to exe-
cute a task in terms of quality and cost, and workload balancing denotes distributing
workload among robots. This framework considers robotâ€™s quality and cost for a task,
and adjusts them in accordance with environmental changes. For workload balanc-
ing, the framework utilizes the concept of subsidy to encourage participation from the
less active members of the robot team. The proposed framework is implemented in a
simulated cleaning mission and simulation results demonstrate that this framework is
capable of adjusting the competency in accordance with environmental changes, and
distributing workload among robots in a balanced manner.
To run the simulation, Webots (https://www.cyberbotics.com/index) robot simulator is required.
